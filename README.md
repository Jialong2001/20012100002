2.The difference between digital signal and analog signalï¼š
Digital data is represented by digital signals, such as a series of intermittent voltage pulses. For example, we can use constant positive voltage to represent binary number 1, and constant negative voltage to represent binary number 0.
Analog data is generally represented by analog signals, such as a series of continuously changing electromagnetic waves (such as electromagnetic waves in radio and television broadcasting) or voltage signals (such as audio voltage signals in telephone transmission).
