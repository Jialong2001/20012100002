### 2. The difference between digital signal and analog signal
* Digital data is represented by digital signals, such as a series of intermittent voltage pulses. For example, we can use constant positive voltage to represent binary number 1, and constant negative voltage to represent binary number 0. 
* Analog data is generally represented by analog signals, such as a series of continuously changing electromagnetic waves (such as electromagnetic waves in radio and television broadcasting) or voltage signals (such as audio voltage signals in telephone transmission).
